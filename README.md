# GemLibPki

<img align="left" height="150" src="doc/images/logo.svg" />

A java library for functionalities in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) of products specified by
gematik

Products specified by gematik which have to deal with PKI will have to handle certificates and
TSLs (TrustedServiceProvider Status List). This library may help to understand the intention of the
specification as a reference implementation.
Please
see [liability limitation](https://fachportal.gematik.de/default-titlegrundsaetzliche-nutzungsbedingungen)
for further information.

* QES handling is not a part of this library.
* Specifications are published at [gematik Fachportal](https://fachportal.gematik.de/).
* [Link to Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.gematik.pki/gemLibPki)

### Remark

Cryptographic private keys used in this project are solely used in test resources for the purpose of
unit tests.
We are fully aware of the content and meaning of the test data. We never publish productive data
willingly.

### Content

##### Certificate checks

- we check against nonQES certificate profiles specified by gematik, not against usages and contexts
- we provide several methods to get information about a certificate and its issuer
- contains checks of all steps defined in TUC_PKI_018 „Zertifikatsprüfung in der TI“ specified in
  gematik document "Übergreifende Spezifikation PKI" (gemSpec_PKI)
- OCSP requests are optional and activated by default
- OCSP responses are verified according to TUC_PKI_006 "OCSP-Abfrage".
  See [OCSP checks](./README.md#ocsp-checks) section.

##### OCSP checks

- OCSP responses can be generated with different properties. By default, a valid OCSP response
  according to rf2560 is generated
- OCSP responses are validated according to TUC_PKI_006 of gemSpec_PKI.
- OCSP validation can be disabled via builder parameter `withOcspCheck` of
  [TucPki018Verifier](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/certificate/TucPki018Verifier.java).

##### TSL handling

- contains checks defined in TUC_PKI_001 „Periodische Aktualisierung TI-Vertrauensraum“ specified in
  gematik document "Übergreifende Spezifikation PKI" (gemSpec_PKI)
- we provide several methods to get information about a TSL. (
  see: [TSL package](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl))
- methods for parsing, modifying, signing and validation of a TSL

Attention: the trust anchor change mechanism is not completely implemented in this library,
because it has to be part of the TSL downloading component. An example of an implementation
can be found in the system under test simulator of the gematik PKI test
suite: [TslProcurer](https://github.com/gematik/app-PkiTestsuite/blob/1.1.3/pkits-sut-server-sim/src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/pkits/sut/server/sim/tsl/TslProcurer.java)

##### Error codes

- error codes specified by gematik in gemSpec_PKI

### Build

The lib is developed and tested
with [Eclipse Adoptium Temurin JDK 17](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries) and [Apache
Maven 3.9.3](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)

Build with:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Builds are reproducible, to check call

```bash
mvn clean verify artifact:compare
```

in any compatible unix environment.

### Steps to perform certificate checks

- instantiate a [TslReader](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl/TslReader.java) to read a TSL
- use the result of the TslReader to instantiate
  a [TslInformationProvider](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl/TslInformationProvider.java)
  and call its public methods
- get TspServices from TslInformationProvider
- instantiate
  a [TucPki018Verifier](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/certificate/TucPki018Verifier.java)
  (via builder) and call its public method `performTucPki018Checks(x509EeCert)`

### Steps to perform TSL checks

- instantiate a [TslReader](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl/TslReader.java) to read a TSL
- use the result of the TslReader to instantiate
  a [TslInformationProvider](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl/TslInformationProvider.java)
  and call its public methods
- get TspServices from TslInformationProvider
- instantiate
  a [TucPki001Verifier](src/main/java/de/gematik/pki/gemlibpki/tsl/TucPki001Verifier.java) (via
  builder) and call its public method `performTucPki001Checks()`
- the offline mode for TUC_PKI_001 (used solely for a Konnektor) is not implemented
